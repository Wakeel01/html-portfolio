<p>A quick story that proves my ability to master any environment i find myself.
  I have studied basic IT - A+, N+ and MCSE, struggling to find work in this field I joined a construction company with my Uncle to keep busy 
  and providing for my family while searching for an opportunity in my field. It took me 1 year to strike a job and during my time in construction
  I have developed the ability to build (bricklayer) and become a Tiler being able to set out and lay the actual tiles. After I started at at Telkom 
  as a technical Support Staff member the manager Identified some leadership skill witin me and soon became one of the best Team leaders that department
  has seen, leading for seven years I used my skills and abilities to move into Sales which I have been thriving in over time.
